**algorithm practice codes**

in December 2017, i found interesting to make youtube videos on
sorting and searching algorithms in C language.

here are codes altogether also below the video tutorial's links:

_`selection sort:`_ http://bit.ly/2DeOyuM

_`linear search:`_ http://bit.ly/2D9FCa4

_`binary search:`_ http://bit.ly/2DaHqje

_`bubble sort:`_ http://bit.ly/2DgeiqJ


today is my weekend, so thought to reorganise all those abstract repo into a single repo. Thanks
